      <quarry>
        <flavor>This place has clearly been an expedition point some time, because they left a huge quarry behind..</flavor>
        <flavor>This looks like some sort of crater. when close up, however, you see that it is in fact a large quarry.</flavor>
        <flavor>Upon arrival at the island, you see a large quarry in the center. this location has obviously had a lot of riches, but are there any left?</flavor>

        <flavor>As you come close, your castle is almost hit by all the floating rocks that are floating all over. Something is making the earth behave like this.</flavor>
